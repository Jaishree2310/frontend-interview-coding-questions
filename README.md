## Introduction

Machine coding rounds in frontend interviews assess a candidate's ability to translate requirements into functional code, handle user interactions, manage state, and create reusable components. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive list of commonly asked questions, along with guidelines on how to approach them.

### 1. Build a Responsive Image Gallery

**Requirements:**
- Display a grid of images
- Implement lazy loading for better performance
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes
- Add lightbox functionality for image preview

**Key Considerations:**
- Use of CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout
- Implementation of Intersection Observer API for lazy loading
- Handling of image loading states and errors
- Accessibility considerations for the lightbox feature

### 2. Create a Todo List Application

**Requirements:**
- Allow users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete
- Implement data persistence (local storage)
- Add filtering options (All, Active, Completed)
- Implement drag and drop for reordering tasks

**Key Considerations:**
- State management (consider using React or Vue for more complex implementations)
- Efficient rendering of list items
- Handling of user input and validation
- Implementing drag and drop functionality

## General Tips

When approaching these coding challenges, keep the following in mind:

1. **Clarify Requirements:** Always start by asking questions to fully understand the problem and requirements.

2. **Plan Before Coding:** Sketch out your component structure and data flow before diving into code.

3. **Start with MVP:** Begin with a Minimum Viable Product and add features incrementally.

4. **Focus on Functionality First:** Ensure core functionality works before styling or optimizing.

5. **Consider Edge Cases:** Think about and handle potential edge cases and error states.

6. **Optimize Performance:** Consider performance implications, especially for larger datasets.

7. **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-commented code that others can easily understand and maintain.

8. **Testing:** If time allows, add some basic tests or explain how you would approach testing.

9. **Accessibility:** Keep basic accessibility principles in mind, using semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes where necessary.

10. **Explain Your Thought Process:** Communicate your decisions and trade-offs as you code.
